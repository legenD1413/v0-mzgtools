Since the file `public/images/SWD60.png` is an image file, and the update provides a new URL for the image, the task is to update the source of the image. There is no code to merge. The instruction is to replace the existing image with the image from the new URL. Therefore, the solution is to simply note the new URL.

New image URL: https://hebbkx1anhila5yf.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/SWD60-nutUUyGJ0DlXG3PCKMF5FBtEZyqBAk.png
