    question: "What is a Right Angle Flat End Mill?",
    answer: "A Right Angle Flat End Mill is a cutting tool designed with 90-degree corner geometry for precision machining of flat surfaces, grooves, and stepped surfaces. These end mills feature sharp corners that create clean, square edges in workpieces.",

  {
    page_url: "/standard-tools/milling/right-angle-flat", 
    question: "What materials can be machined with these end mills?",
    answer: "Our Right Angle Flat End Mills are available in different hardness ranges (HRC45-65) and can machine various materials including general steel, hardened steel, stainless steel, cast iron, copper, aluminum, and other non-ferrous metals depending on the specific coating and configuration.",

  {
    page_url: "/standard-tools/milling/right-angle-flat",
    question: "What's the difference between coated and uncoated versions?",
    answer: "Coated versions (nano-coated for HRC60¬∞+ materials) provide superior wear resistance and longer tool life when machining harder materials. Uncoated versions are optimized for softer materials like aluminum, copper, and non-ferrous metals where coating might interfere with surface finish.",

    page_url: "/standard-tools/milling/right-angle-flat",
    question: "What are the recommended cutting parameters?",
    answer: "Cutting parameters vary by material and tool configuration. Generally:\n- Use lower speeds for harder materials\n- Increase feed rates with more flutes\n- Maintain proper coolant flow\n- Adjust depth of cut based on material hardness\nContact our technical team for specific parameter recommendations for your application.",
